# WebTorrent App - Context and Progress

## 2025-05-30 - Major Fixes and Improvements

### Fixed Issues
1. **Non-functional Download Buttons**
   - Added missing `startDownload` method to handle button clicks
   - Implemented proper magnet link validation
   - Added user feedback for invalid inputs

2. **WebSocket Communication**
   - Fixed "Unknown Message Type" errors
   - Resolved message parsing issues
   - Added proper error handling for malformed messages

3. **Connection Handling**
   - Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Added ping/pong mechanism for connection health monitoring
   - Fixed issues with multiple concurrent reconnection attempts

### Working Features
1. **Core Functionality**
   - ✓ Starting downloads via magnet links
   - ✓ Tracking download progress
   - ✓ Displaying active downloads
   - ✓ Showing downloaded files
   - ✓ Handling multiple simultaneous downloads

2. **WebSocket Communication**
   - ✓ Real-time updates for download progress
   - ✓ Automatic reconnection on network issues
   - ✓ Proper cleanup of resources on disconnect

3. **User Interface**
   - ✓ Responsive feedback for user actions
   - ✓ Clear error messages
   - ✓ Download progress visualization

### Technical Implementation
1. **WebSocket Server**
   - Robust message handling
   - Connection state management
   - Error recovery mechanisms

2. **Client-Side**
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Proper state management
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Important Notes for Future Development
1. **Code Structure**
   - All WebSocket communication follows the message format: `{ type: string, ...payload }`
   - Error handling is centralized for consistency
   - Logging is implemented for debugging purposes

2. **Dependencies**
   - WebSocket for real-time communication
   - WebTorrent for torrent handling
   - Express for the web server

3. **Known Limitations**
   - Large numbers of simultaneous downloads may impact performance
   - No built-in download queue (can be added if needed)
   - Basic error recovery (can be enhanced)

## Recent Working Changes (Preserve These)
- WebSocket message structure and handling
- Download initialization and tracking
- Connection management and recovery
- User interface updates for download status
